  				The picture above shows a brief sketch of the microwave in my house. Users could start a reheating procedure directly by setting the reheating time and press “start”. Alternatively, upon selecting the mode corresponding to the type of food that you want to put in, the microwave will adjust the heating time and frequency accordingly. This microwave has additional features such as disinfecting, defrost, and deodorize, etc..

  		<h3 class="sub-header"> Observation </h3>
  		<p class = "Observation description">
  				I observed 3 users throughout a day about their daily interactions with the microwave in my house. Each user used the microwave for about 3 to 4 times. I found their behaviors all shared something in common: none of them selected a heating mode and let the microwave adjust the heating time for them, instead they adjust heating time manually without selecting any mode. Other behaviors of them differed. I list some details in the section below:

                <li> Does not necessarily set the heating time precisely as the time he wishes to heat; instead, chooses a heating time that is convenient to set on the microwave’s interface. For example, the microwave has four kinds of time setting buttons:  “10 minutues”, “1 minute”, “10 seconds”, and “1 second”. When user 2 wants to set the heating time for 40 seconds, he presses the “1 minute” button and cancels the procedure at the 40 seconds because he only needs to press “1 minute” once by doing so. He needs to press “10 seconds” for 4 times if he uses the other way </li>

      To help me better understand their user behaviors, I asked the following questions:
    </h6>

    <div class = "list">
        <li> On a scale of 1-5, please rate the efficiency of this microwave. </li>
        <li> What kind of tasks do you use this microwave to complete? </li>
        <li> Of all the time you are using this microwave, about what percentage of time you are spending on performing each of the tasks that you mentioned in answering Question 2? </li>
        <li> When you are performing different tasks with this microwave, do you usually press a button according to the modes and let it decide the frequency and time, or do you adjust the frequency and time by yourself? </li>
        <li> How do you decide the time that you are setting when you perform different tasks? </li>
        <li> Tell me about the thoughts that went through your head when you were trying to use the interface of this microwave.  </li>
        <li> What’s your alternatives to this microwave? </li>
        <li> How do you think of those alternatives compared to using this microwave?  </li>
        <li> Is there any feature or ways to use the microwave that you don’t know about before but was taught by another person or another channel/media such as facebook, tiktok, youtube, TV? </li>

                <p>
                  As for the interface of this microwave, user 1 said she never used those different kinds of modes for reheating. She manually adjusts the time by her experience. When asking about the thoughts on the interface of this microwave, user 1 said if someone are using the mode feature of the microwave, she doesn’t think that microwave could actually complete the tasks well. According to user 1, “I think those modes are fake”.  She doesn’t believe the mode which says “milk/coffee” could actually heat the milk well because the microwave doesn’t know how much milk or coffee she is putting into the microwave. However, user 1 never tried pressing any of the mode buttons, so she didn’t get her reasoning from having a bad experience. She said she just believed the microwave wouldn’t know the weight or let users input the weight of the foods or drinks. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  For user 1, her alternative to this microwave includes an oven, a frying pan, and a steamer, and she chooses the alternative according to the kind of thing she wants to heat. Lastly, she was never taught by anyone or any channel about learning news feature of a microwave.

                <p>
                  User 2 never pressed any mode button on the microwave, because he thinks selecting the modes would take more effort than merely setting the time. He said if he wants to learn how to use those modes, he has to find the right mode from all those different kind of modes on the interface for a couple of times, which would be more complicated than following a routine that is straightforward, that is, only adjusting the time each time. He adjusts the heating time according to his experience.

                </p>

                <p>
                  For user 2, his alternative to this microwave is a steamer, and he thinks as for reheating leftover dishes, steamer would make the food taste better than the microwave. However, he still uses the microwave 90% of the time because he thinks it would be more convenient. Lastly, he learned how to cook oatmeal using a microwave on YouTube.

                <p>
                  User 3 never pressed any mode button on the microwave, and according to him, he never paid attention to those modes and somtimes forgot the existence about the modes. It’s quite interesting to me, because while the mode buttons and the time buttons are on the same interface, user 3 would obviously see the mode buttons when he is setting the time, but he ignore these modes. I asked followup questions to seek explanations, and he said because he thought microwaves are supposed to only be used to heating things and adjusting the heating time is enough to complete the tasks he wished to complete, so there’s no need to learn about other modes. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  User 3 adjusts heating time according to his experience, but he said he often sets the heating time for too long so that the foods are too hot to eat. Lastly, he found other people use microwaves to make popcorns or cook dishes on Tiktok, but he never tried doing so because he believes microwaves are specialized in heating things in a certain way but not cooking, so he doesn’t believe microwaves could do a good job for those tasks.

      <h3 class="sub-header"> Persona </h3>

      <h6>
        After summarizing the information in my interviews, I construct two personas: Busy Lazy Brandon and Home-cooking Master Hanna.
      </h6>

      <h6>
          Persona 1: Busy Lazy Brandon
      </h6>
      <li> a married man with a busy full-time job </li>
      <li> rarely cooks, but helps his wife preparing for dinners occasionally </li>
      <li> sets the heating time manually when using the microwave </li>
      <li> never uses the modes buttons on the microwave, which will suggest a heating time and frequency for the corresponding foods listed on the modes </li>
      <li> about ⅓ of the time when Brandon is using a microwave, he either underheats the food or ends up making the food too hot to eat </li>
      <li> he wants to be as efficient as possible as long as the foods taste okay </li>

          Persona 2: Home-cooking Master Hanna
      </h6>
      <li> a married mother with a busy full-time job </li>
      <li> cooks everyday, uses microwave to reheat leftover dishes everyday </li>
      <li> sets the heating time manually when using the microwave; rarely overheats or underheats anything because she has ample experience using the microwave </li>
      <li> doesn’t trust the microwave could reheat different kinds of foods well upon selecting the corresponding modes because microwave doesn’t have the information and experience as she does </li>
      <li> her goal is to make the foods taste good while being as efficient as possible </li>
